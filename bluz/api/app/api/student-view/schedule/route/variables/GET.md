Defined in: [ui/src/app/api/student-view/schedule/route.ts:31](https://github.com/System-B90/Bluz/blob/1b02178048002eee34d502b2e3e2a402e1b9c9c0/ui/src/app/api/student-view/schedule/route.ts#L31)

The only endpoint a student session may call (#656). It is read-only, serves
a single day, and returns the `StudentEvent` projection — never a raw event
document. There is deliberately no POST/PUT/DELETE here.

Iteration scoping: students are pinned to the current iteration. Staff may
pass `?it=` while previewing, exactly as the rest of the calendar does.
