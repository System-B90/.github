# Function: slightOverlapEnds()

> **slightOverlapEnds**\<`TEvent`\>(`events`, `accessors`): `Map`\<`TEvent`, `Date`\>

Defined in: [ui/src/components/student-view/no-overlap-layout.ts:38](https://github.com/System-B90/Bluz/blob/2fa23325da73d58527b069b0943f3bd1e838efee/ui/src/components/student-view/no-overlap-layout.ts#L38)

For each event that runs at most [SLIGHT\_OVERLAP\_MS](../variables/SLIGHT_OVERLAP_MS.md) into a later
one, the later event's start: where the layout should consider it ended.
Starting together is never "slight"; those still share the column.
