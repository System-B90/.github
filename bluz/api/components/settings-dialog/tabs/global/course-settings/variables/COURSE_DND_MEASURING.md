# Variable: COURSE\_DND\_MEASURING

> `const` **COURSE\_DND\_MEASURING**: `MeasuringConfiguration`

Defined in: [ui/src/components/settings-dialog/tabs/global/course-settings/index.tsx:132](https://github.com/System-B90/Bluz/blob/d3e66c57dbea172998b0f35d995d47c87fad995d/ui/src/components/settings-dialog/tabs/global/course-settings/index.tsx#L132)

Re-measure drop targets throughout the drag. The layout shifts after a drag
starts, and with the default (measure once at drag start) the root drop
zone's stored rect no longer matched where it was drawn: releasing on the
zone hit nothing and un-nesting silently failed (#771).
