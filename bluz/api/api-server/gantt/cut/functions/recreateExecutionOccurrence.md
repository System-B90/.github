# Function: recreateExecutionOccurrence()

> **recreateExecutionOccurrence**(`curriculumId`, `ganttEventId`, `occurrenceDate`): `Promise`\<[`RecreateOccurrenceOutcome`](../type-aliases/RecreateOccurrenceOutcome.md)\>

Defined in: [ui/src/api-server/gantt/cut.ts:1305](https://github.com/System-B90/Bluz/blob/59b35ec547ab85fc4cb04fc9443883a2e8840381/ui/src/api-server/gantt/cut.ts#L1305)

Re-create the schedule event(s) for one gantt-event occurrence that was cut
and later deleted from the schedule (#682). Re-runs the full materialization
(same computation as a cut/reload) and inserts only the document(s) matching
`(ganttEventId, occurrenceDate)`, so the recreated event matches the gantt
plan exactly. Refuses when a live event already occupies that occurrence —
the caller should delete it first if it wants to replace it.

## Parameters

### curriculumId

`string`

### ganttEventId

`string`

### occurrenceDate

`string`

## Returns

`Promise`\<[`RecreateOccurrenceOutcome`](../type-aliases/RecreateOccurrenceOutcome.md)\>
