# Type Alias: AiEventSummary

> **AiEventSummary** = `ReturnType`\<*typeof* `summarizeEvent`\>

Defined in: [ui/src/api-server/ai/tools/calendar.ts:50](https://github.com/System-B90/Bluz/blob/29b32f987e27f991aca78ed635c3b34fa6d4c458/ui/src/api-server/ai/tools/calendar.ts#L50)

Trimmed view of an event — the full document is far too large to re-send,
and a narrow projection means a schema change on the document cannot
silently widen what the assistant sees.

Exported so the benchmark fixture answers with exactly this shape rather
than an approximation of it.
