Defined in: [ui/src/api-client/server-time.ts:13](https://github.com/System-B90/Bluz/blob/d025a8d42fb581c0b03907e922b963d1295ddc4b/ui/src/api-client/server-time.ts#L13)

The server clock — the only source of "now" for the student board, and of
"today" for the staff calendar.

The device clock rides along as a header so the server can flag a student
who wound it. That is its only use: nothing on either side is computed
from it.
